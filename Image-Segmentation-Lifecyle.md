# Image Segmentation Lifecycle

## Labeling:

### Labeling Process Options
- Manual Annotation:
  - Pros: Highly accurate when done by experts.
  - Cons: Time-consuming and requires expertise.
- Semi-Automated Tools:
  -  Pros: Faster than manual annotation; user-guided tools improve accuracy.
  -  Cons: May require manual corrections; depends on tool quality.
- Automated Segmentation Algorithms:
  - Pros: Fast and efficient for large datasets.
  - Cons: May lack precision; requires validation.
- Deep Learning Models:
  - Pros: Can handle complex patterns and large datasets.
  - Cons: Requires large annotated dataset for training.
- Thresholding Techniques:
  - Pros: Simple and effective for high-contrast images.
  - Cons: Not suitable for complex or low-contrast images.
- Region-Based Methods:
  - Pros: Good for images with distinct regions.
  - Cons: Can struggle with overlapping or touching objects.
- Edge Detection Techniques:
  - Pros: Effective for outlining shapes.
  - Cons: May miss fine details or internal features.
- Interactive Tools (e.g., ITK-SNAP, LabelMe):
  - Pros: User-friendly; combines manual and automated methods.
  - Cons: May require some learning curve.
Choosing the Best Method: Depends on image characteristics, available resources, required accuracy, and specific application needs. Often, a combination of methods is employed for optimal results

### Manually labelling process:

- Choose an Annotation Tool: Select a tool suitable for image annotation (e.g., LabelMe, ITK-SNAP, or custom software).
- Load the Image: Import the image into the annotation tool.
- Identify Regions of Interest (ROIs): Carefully examine the image to identify the areas you need to label, such as specific organs, lesions, or abnormalities.
- Draw Boundaries:
Use the tool's features to draw boundaries around the ROIs.
- For precise segmentation, zoom in and carefully outline the edges.
- Use polygon tools for irregular shapes or brush tools for freeform drawing.
- Label the Regions:
Assign labels or tags to the segmented regions (e.g., "lung," "tumor").
- Ensure consistency in labeling across images for uniformity.
- Refine Segmentation:
Adjust the boundaries for accuracy.
Revisit and modify any areas that are not accurately captured.
- Save the Mask:
Save the segmented mask, usually as a binary image where the ROI is marked distinctly from the background.
- Ensure the mask aligns correctly with the original image.
- Quality Check:
Review the labeled images for consistency and accuracy.
- If possible, have another expert validate the annotations.
- Documentation:
Document the process and criteria used for segmentation.
This is crucial for reproducibility and understanding the dataset.
- Repeat for Dataset:
Manually label a representative set of images from the dataset.
Consistency across the dataset is key for training reliable models.
