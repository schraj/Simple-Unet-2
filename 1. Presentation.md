# Presentation

## Agenda
- Overview of Medical Image Segmentation
- Overview of the implementation, which is a pytorch-based U-Net model architecture
- Tuning procedure and decisions made along the way to improve performance.
- Deployment(on kaggle) and inference

## Overview of Medical Image Segmentation

Look at Torso image, Target mask and how it fits over lung.  
  - Images are open in "Preview App"

Motivation: 
  - Why do we need this?
    - Identify regions of interest
    - Facilitate diagnosis
    - Enhance downstream image analysis
    - Support surgical planning
    - Quantitative analysis
    - First step in a multi-step analysis:
      - Focus a second round of analysis on this identified "segment".  Improves speed, reduces noise, reduces computation.

- Look at latest notebook:
  - https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeremyschrader1/unet-lung-segmentation

  - Look at input images merged with mask
  - Look at good result images merged with mask

Look at bad result
  - A bad result(5 conv layers)
  - https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeremyschrader1/unet-lung-segmentation?scriptVersionId=150453643

#### Overview of the problem
Image segmentation can be multi-class or binary(two-class).  We are looking currently at a binary, two-class image segmentation problem.

Each pixel is binary classification problem
  - Either it is lung:1 or not-lung:0
  - Model will try to predict each pixel and the output score from the model will be between 0 and 1
  - Any predicted value above .5 = 1(lung) and any below .5=0(not lung)
  - Loss function will look at how to make more pixels in the prediction match the pixels(0 or 1) in the target mask
  - Loss functions used were Dice Coefficient and Binary Cross Entropy/Log Loss

  ```
  The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. Dice coefficient is 2 times The area of Overlap divided by the total number of pixels in both the images.
  ```

### Labeling
[Labeling information](2.%20Image-Segmentation-Lifecyle.md)

For medical image labelling, you'll need greater precision that for other types(e.g. labeling objects for Autonomous Vehicle learning).  
- Manual
- With proprietary tools


## Overview of Implementation
Walk through notebook.
Notes on each stage are in ReadMe.Md

### Preparation of Kaggle
Look at Notebook

Also, here is stripped down version of these concepts:
- https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeremyschrader1/kaggle-with-github-repo

Some quick notes on how the workbook and repo are set up to work together.

Use console to see if image files are there:
`/kaggle/input/pulmonary-chest-xray-abnormalities/ChinaSet_AllFiles`

### Preparation of Data
Look at ReadMe.Md
Show sample images in Notebook


### Data Pipeline
Look at ReadMe.Md

### Training Loop
Show call from Notebook
Show processor, trainer, model in code

### Test Phase
Show call from Notebook and result images
Step back to 2 bad results notebooks

## Tuning
See [tuning](./3.%20Tuning.md)


## Deployment and Inference
Look at Readme.MD for Kaggle method
Serverless.py for sample AWS Lambda method


## Finally. Learning
1. The data/image manipulation had a higher learning curve than expected.  Mixing image libraries led to unexpected formatting.
2. As always, get the simplest thing possible working and then iterate.
3. As you get to know the model and start fiddling with parameters, you start to get an intuition about what things are working.
4. Look closely at the actual results(images) and not just the evaluation scores
