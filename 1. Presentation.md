# Presentation

## Agenda
- Overview of Medical Image Segmentation
- Overview of the implementation, which is a pytorch-based U-Net model architecture
- Tuning procedure and decisions made along the way to improve performance.
- Deployment(on kaggle) and inference

## Overview of Medical Image Segmentation

Look at Torso image, Target mask and how it fits over lung.  
  - Images are open in "Preview App"

Motivation: 
  - Why do we need this?
    - Identify regions of interest
    - Facilitate diagnosis
    - Enhance downstream image analysis
    - Support surgical planning
    - Quantitative analysis
    - First step in a multi-step analysis:
      - Focus a second round of analysis on this identified "segment".  Improves speed, reduces noise, reduces computation.

- Look at latest notebook:
  - https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeremyschrader1/unet-lung-segmentation

  - Look at input images merged with mask
  - Look at good result images merged with mask

Look at bad result
  - A bad result(5 conv layers)

#### Overview of the problem

Each pixel is binary classification problem
  - Either it is lung:1 or not-lung:0
  - Model will try to predict each pixel and the output score from the model will be between 0 and 1
  - Any predicted value above .5 = 1(lung) and any below .5=0(not lung)
  - Loss function will look at how to make more pixels in the prediction match the pixels(0 or 1) in the target mask
  - Loss functions used were Dice Coefficient and Binary Cross Entropy/Log Loss

  ```
  The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. Dice coefficient is 2 times The area of Overlap divided by the total number of pixels in both the images.
  ```

### Labeling
[Labeling information](2.%20Image-Segmentation-Lifecyle.md)

For medical image labelling, you'll need greater precision that for other types(e.g. labeling objects for Autonomous Vehicle learning).  
- Manual
- With tools such as ITK-SNAP, LabelMe
